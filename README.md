# eoffice
Export and import graphics and tables to MicroSoft office
## Description
_eoffice_ provide wrap functions to export and import graphics and data.frames in R to MicroSoft office (docx, pptx format)
And _eoffice_ also provide write out figures with lots of different formats, such as pdf, eps, emf, tiff, svg, wmf, png and jpeg. _eoffice_ also support write out or display ggplot2 type figure with plotly. Since people may work on the platform without GUI support, _eoffice_ also provide function to easily write out figures to all above formats, pptx and docx.
## Installation
```
library(devtools)
install_github("guokai8/eoffice")
``` 

## Software Usage

```
library(eoffice)
library(ggplot2)
## make a figure with you custom function
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp)
topptx(filename = "mtcars.pptx")
## You can also use ggplot 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp, color = factor(cyl))) + geom_point()
topptx(filename = "mtcars.pptx")
## or todocx(filename = "mtcars.docx")
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp, color = factor(cyl))) + geom_point()
topptx(p, filename = "mtcars.pptx", width = 6, height = 4)
## use above method if you want use topptx with ggplot function in a loop
## write out table to office
totable(head(mtcars), filename = "mtcars.docx")
totable(head(mtcars), filename = "mtcars.pptx")
## append was supported if you want add figures or tables.
## Now support direct output of common objects produced by R statistical functions
tt <- t.test(wt ~ am, mtcars)
totable(tt, filename = "mtcars_test.pptx")
totable(t.test(wt ~ am, mtcars), filename = "mtcars_test.pptx")
## inpptx and indocx provide function read the tables in pptx or docx
tabs <- inpptx(filename = "mtcars.pptx", header = TRUE)
## output different figure formats
tofigure(ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp, color = factor(cyl))) + geom_point(),filename = "mtcars.pdf")
tofigure(ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp, color = factor(cyl))) + geom_point(),filename = "mtcars.eps")
## display figure with plotly
tohtml(p, save = FALSE)
## if you use basic plot function or other plot function you need first use convertplot to convert 
## it to ggplot object when you are working on the platform without GUI
p <- convertplot(plot(1:10))
tofigure(p, filename = "test.pdf")
topptx(p, filename = "test.pptx")
## if you use ggplot like function you don't need to transform the format
```
## Note
The _eoffice_ just a package for funs. _eoffice_ depends on _officer_ and _rvg_ package which include lots of fantastic functions. Here, _eoffice_ provides simplified functions which could be save some time to learn the complete functions from above packages. And there are some packages provide these functions. Comparing with these packages, _eoffice_ include own features which I think really helpful to me.  Besides, _eoffice_ also provide functions to read tables from pptx and docx. Read graphics functions will be available soon.
